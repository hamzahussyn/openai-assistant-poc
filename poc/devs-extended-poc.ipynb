      "\n",
      "1. **Curiosity and Observational Skills**: Haziq has the experience of being involved in the entire lifecycle of the user experience (UX) from designing new concepts to implementation【7†source】. This not only shows his curiosity but also his observational skills to refine ideas into functional designs by using different methodologies such as mock-ups, prototypes, and user flows.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Good Listening Skills**: His use of both quantitative and qualitative research is indicative of his strong listening skills as it would require understanding user issues and feedback to guide his design process.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Translating Designs into Customer Value**: Haziq has been recognized for his ability to articulate and present ideas effectively, contributing towards innovation and creativity, which is essential in adding value to customers with the designs.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Experience in UI/UX**: He comes across as someone who understands the technicalities as well as the art of user-centric design. This balance is critical for HR roles that increasingly depend on digital platforms to engage employees and enhance their experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Strong Work History in Relevant Field**: He has demonstrated an ability to work independently with developers for designing web, mobile, and dashboard layouts. This shows his versatility and ability to understand the technical constraints and collaboration that new age HR systems may involve.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Impact and Achievements**: While other candidates also have solid experience, Haziq stands out for being thorough in his approach and having an award for creativity, which suggests he has the ability to lead projects to successful and innovative outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the information does not provide enough specifics on Laeeq Ahmed's interaction with users or his curiosity and observational skills related to the design process. Multazim Siddiqui has strong abilities, particularly in the mobile UI/UX and front-end development area. However, his experience seems to be more focused on screen experience rather than the broader user research and teamwork that we are looking for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, Haziq Bin Ayub's blend of technical UI/UX experience, proven user-engagement process, and innovation-driven work history aligns best with the needs of an HR department looking for a candidate who can not only design but also enhance user experiences.\n"
